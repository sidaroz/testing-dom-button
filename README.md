# Exercises
Working in pairs:
1. **Create a webpage that has**:
- A H1 tag
- A H2 tag
- A Header that contains a list of navigation items, styled to be horizontal across the top of the screen
- A section which contains three paragraphs, each paragraph should correspond to an item on your header

2. **Create the following events on your webpage**
- If a user clicks on the h1 tag,  the background should change colour, if they move their mouse out of the space the background should return to the original colour.
- If a user hovers over a h2 tag replace the words inside it to contain a greeting
- If someone types a letter whilst viewing the webpage a new paragraph should be created and that letter should be added to it.
- If someone clicks on one of the navigation items the styling of the connecting paragraph should change to be more bold and be a larger font size. If they click again on the same navigation item, the paragraph should revert to original styling.

3. **Testing**
- Take a look at the test suite in the demo code
- Try adding some Jest tests for the existing features in your webpage
- Add test(s) for a feature that you have not yet implemented - maybe an easter egg!
- Use your new test(s) to help you add the new feature
